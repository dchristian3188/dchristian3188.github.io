title: Why Writing A PowerShell Module Is Getting Harder
---

Writing a PowerShell module is hard.
A lot harder than it use to be.
Honestly  it's your fault.
Not just you, but the whole PowerShell community.
Apparently we're a mature language now and everybody is demanding more.
I mean I was just starting to accept that fact that I have to include Pester tests, but now I need documentation too?
Geez, what else does it take to write a professional quality module these days?

**The Good Stuff:**
The skills you should be investing in to make a quality module.

# PowerShell

This one seems obvious, but you need to be good at PowerShell.
I feel like there's levels of progression people go through with PowerShell

1. I know a couple of commands
1. I can save a commands in a ps1 file
1. I make my own functions / my scripts take parameters
1. I make modules / DSC resources.

The thing is by the time you realize you need a module, you're already pretty mature in your PowerShell journey.

# Pester

[Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) is the testing framework chosen by not only the community but the PowerShell team themselves.
In fact, Pester was the first open source project to actually ship with Windows.
The great part is it's written in all PowerShell and can do some really amazing things.
