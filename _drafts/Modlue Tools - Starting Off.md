title: Modlue Tools - Starting Off
---

This is going to be the first in a series of posts related to working with module tools.
In my [previous article](http://overpoweredshell.com//Tools-Module-Authors-Should-Leverage/), I talked about what tools module authors should leverage.
Now I want to walk through using these tools and demonstrate how they all come together.
To do this, we will be creating a new module called HideWindowsExplorerDrives.
The purpose of this module is to make hiding and showing explorer drives easier.
The code is beside the point.
I want to focus more on how we can use some of these community projects to take our module to the next level.

**The Good Stuff:**
Setting up a new module project using my [Plater Template](https://github.com/dchristian3188/PlasterTemplates)

Let's be honest, at this point Plaster Module templates are like... opionins everyone got one.
I will be covering mine today, not because I think its better than anyone elses, but because it works for me.
Thats the whole point of a Plaster.
Customize it to fit your needs.
Over the past couple of months, I have been maintining [this template.](https://github.com/dchristian3188/PlasterTemplates/tree/master/Module)
Realistically,  I still don't think its finished.
I feel a module template is a very dynamic thing.
After every proejct I go back and see if there's anything I can add.

First start off setting up the folders.
